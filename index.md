1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic in my domain this quarter was fairness metrics. The idea that fairness is something that is impossible to objectively quantify is fascinating to me, and I want to know what the best way to do so is with our limited tools available to us.
2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I'm curious if there are any major failings in commonly used fairness metrics. I'd like to do an examination to see if there are any as of yet unknown notable flaws within them, or if there are some already known, how they have had negative effects upon users of them unknowingly.
3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
In our replication project thus far, we haven't delved too extensively into the advantages and disadvantages of individual fairness metrics. I'd like to look further into what advantages each one has over others.
4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would be interested in doing a deeper dive into AIF360. It seems like a really powerful tool, and I don't know as much about it as I should.
